# Manage-teams-turbo

## Description

This application is intended to both serve as the means for business leaders to manage their teams as well as for the team to understand the business at large. It can be a hassle for manager to update their 'org charts' everytime they need to show it to investors or in presentations. Similarly, new hires need the means to learn where they fit in the business. This application makes it easy to keep an updated org chart and learn from it. I learned the value of modularization, strictly with reggards to functions.

## Installation

Open my repo, linked above, and download the code. Open the code in whatever platform you're working with and deploy the code in browser after running it in your platform to see the html generated.

## Usage

Open the index.js file and run the file. The user will be prompted to answer questions and the line of questioning will depend upon the needs of the manager or employee.

## Credits

I worked with two tutors, read many articles and chatted with classmates to get the ideas for this project.

## Features

We use inquirer, mysql2 and console.table.
